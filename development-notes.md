- The project doesn't compile and has uncommitted changes I don't understand. Going to commit them
  and add a travis config.
- Some packages have package.yaml's that are not used.
- I'm on some wierd branch ... that is going to be become master ... at least for now.
- Had to make repo public to get CI ... oh well.
- CI is failing on hspec-discover not being on the path ... twitter probably knows how to fix that.
- Someone on twitter had an answer: https://twitter.com/GeorgeTalksCode/status/1211915225999364096?s=20
